title: Analog
description: "This collection preserves the raw beauty of analog capture—each frame a tactile artifact of light and chemistry. Bound in a textured album, these images celebrate film’s imperfections: the grainy textures, muted palettes, and serendipitous light leaks that digital perfection often erases. A tactile journey through time, where every faded edge and soft focus whispers nostalgia for the deliberate craft of shooting on film."
