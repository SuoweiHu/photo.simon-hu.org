description: So, you found me. Though I am no professional photographer (9-5 software engineer is who I really am), I enjoy taking shots of random stuff so I can recall the good memories as I grow older. While I am still learning and experimenting with different techniques, I hope you can enjoy browsing through my collection. You can also find me via the following...
resources:
  - src: ./static/favicon.ico
    params:
      cover: true # cover of the home page is used for OpenGraph cards, etc.
menus:
  main:
    name: Home
    weight: -1
# sub-galleries on list pages are sorted by date and weight (descending)
